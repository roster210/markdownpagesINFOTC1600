# Github Retrospective

I use GitHub daily, and I guess I had no idea about the process that went into building a repository and its files. I always found it amusing there was always a `readme.md` file. My brain never tied Markdown to that `.md`, only medical doctor. They always seemed to be files to help with whatever was in the repository. So, even though I figured it was not correct, I found "doctor" to be an appropriate title for such.

- The retrospective assignment confused me because it had a due date and time but nowhere to submit it, so I figured I would get it to you somehow.
  
- Also, I want to let you know that since I have `git-all` installed and always updated on all my Linux devices, I SSH into a Radxa Pi 4B+ to clone my repository. This repository will nowc contain a file that shows my whole SSH communication with the Pi for that session.

To the Professor,
Thank you for this semester; you taught me a lot, and you also taught me that I do not know nearly as much as I thought I did about computers and tools on them, even though I use them every day! I am not CS or IT, but since I enjoy your classes so much, I will take them any chance I can until I graduate.

Thank you.
