Welcome to the world of 3D printing! This page provides a brief introduction to 3D printing technology.

## What is 3D Printing?

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects layer by layer from a digital model.

## Key Components

### 1. **3D Printer:**
- Choose a printer that suits your needs, considering factors like print volume, resolution, and material compatibility.

### 2. **Filaments:**
- Explore different filaments like PLA, ABS, or PETG, each with unique properties.

## Getting Started

1. **Select a 3D Printer:**
- Research and choose a 3D printer that aligns with your budget and requirements.

2. **Download a Model:**
- Find a 3D model online or create your own using CAD software.

3. **Slice and Print:**
- Use slicing software to convert the 3D model into printable layers and start printing.

Happy Printing!
