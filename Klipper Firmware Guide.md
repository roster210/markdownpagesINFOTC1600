# Klipper Firmware Guide

Welcome to the Klipper firmware guide, your go-to resource for understanding and implementing Klipper on your 3D printer.

## What is Klipper Firmware?

Klipper is a high-performance 3D printer firmware that runs on a separate microcontroller, offloading the complex computations from your printer's mainboard. This results in improved print quality and allows for advanced features.

## Key Features

### 1. **High-Speed Printing:**
- Leverage Klipper's efficient code execution for faster and smoother printing.

### 2. **Delta Printers:**
- Ideal for delta-style 3D printers, Klipper excels in handling the kinematics of these systems.

### 3. **OctoPrint Integration:**
- Seamlessly integrate Klipper with OctoPrint for a comprehensive 3D printing experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Compatible Hardware:**
- Check if your 3D printer's mainboard is compatible with Klipper. Many popular boards are supported.

2. **Installation:**
- Follow the installation guide provided on the Klipper GitHub repository to flash the firmware onto your microcontroller.

3. **Configuration:**
- Customize your printer configuration by editing the Klipper configuration files to match your printer's specifications.

4. **Tuning and Calibration:**
- Fine-tune your printer settings and perform calibration for optimal print results.
